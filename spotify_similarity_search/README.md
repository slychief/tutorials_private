# Finding Similar Songs on Spotify

In this tutorial I will demonstrate how to apply different machine learning techniques to search for similar songs on Spotify. Because the tutorial grew in size, I decided to split it into three parts. 

## Overview

*Part 1* demonstrates the traditional way of extracting features from the audio content, training a classifier and predicting results. Because we do not have access to the raw audio content, we cannot extract features ourselves. Fortunately, Spotify is so generous to provide extracted features via their API. Those are just low-level audio features, but they are more than any other streaming music service provide - so Kudos to Spotify for this API!
